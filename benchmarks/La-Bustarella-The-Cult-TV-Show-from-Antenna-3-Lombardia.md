The show's name, La Bustarella, means "the little envelope" in Italian, and refers to the prize that the guests could win by playing the games. The envelope contained either money or a voucher for a trip or a gift. The show also featured musical performances, comedy sketches, and interviews with celebrities and politicians.
 
La Bustarella was controversial for its explicit content and its criticism of the political and religious establishment. The show was often censored or fined by the authorities, and faced lawsuits from various groups and individuals. Despite the controversy, the show was widely loved by the audience, who appreciated its humor, spontaneity, and irreverence.
 
Today, La Bustarella is considered a cult TV show and a symbol of the Italian television of the 1970s and 1980s. Many of its episodes are available on YouTube[^1^] [^2^], where they have been viewed by thousands of nostalgic fans. The show's host, Ettore Andenna, has also given several interviews about his experience and memories of La Bustarella[^3^].
  
La Bustarella was produced by Antenna 3 Lombardia, a regional broadcaster founded in 1976 by Giorgio Tacchella, a former journalist and politician. The show was directed by Gianni Boncompagni, a famous TV author and producer who had previously worked on RAI, the national public broadcaster. The show's cast included several actors, comedians, singers, and models, such as Gianni Agus, Franco Oppini, Gigi Sabani, Loredana BertÃ¨, and Marisa Laurito. The show also featured "Le Giuseppine", a group of young women who participated in the games and often stripped or posed nude.
 
La Bustarella was inspired by other successful TV shows of the time, such as Il gioco delle coppie (The Couples Game) and Colpo grosso (Big Deal), which also mixed entertainment, eroticism, and satire. However, La Bustarella was more daring and provocative than its predecessors, challenging the moral and political norms of the Italian society of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The show was also innovative for its use of live broadcasting, interactive phone calls, and candid camera pranks.
  
La Bustarella was not only a source of entertainment, but also a platform for social and political commentary. The show often mocked and criticized the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Italian institutions, especially the Christian Democracy party, which dominated the political scene at the time. The show also denounced the influence of the Catholic Church and the Mafia on the Italian society, and defended the rights of women, workers, and minorities. The show's host, Ettore Andenna, was an outspoken journalist and activist, who used his charisma and wit to expose the scandals and injustices of the Italian system.
 
However, La Bustarella also faced a lot of controversy and opposition for its content and style. The show was frequently censored or fined by the Italian Broadcasting Authority (RAI), which accused it of violating the moral and legal norms of broadcasting. The show also received threats and attacks from various groups and individuals, such as politicians, religious leaders, feminists, and even terrorists. The show's studio was bombed twice by unknown assailants, and Andenna was kidnapped and tortured by a neo-fascist group in 1981. The show also faced several lawsuits from people who claimed to have been defamed or offended by the show.
 
Despite the controversy, La Bustarella remained on air until 1984, when Antenna 3 Lombardia was forced to close due to financial difficulties. The show's legacy is still alive today, as it is considered a cult TV show and a symbol of the Italian television of the 1970s and 1980s. Many of its episodes are available on YouTube[^1^] [^2^], where they have been viewed by thousands of nostalgic fans. The show's host, Ettore Andenna, has also given several interviews about his experience and memories of La Bustarella[^3^]. The show has also inspired other TV shows and movies that have used its format or themes, such as Colpo Grosso (Big Deal), Striscia la Notizia (Strip the News), and La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty).
